## Hi I'm sixuzhuï¼Œa graduate student in the Department of Mathematics who loves data science. I am currently working hard to improve my technical skills.

- I'm currently learning [UCB cs61a](https://cs61a.org/) and [UCB data100](https://ds100.org/)
- And I'm trying to find a better way to combine fuzzy integrals with machine learning. If you're into fuzzy mathematics, feel free to reach out. Let's learn together!
